# BMD Deep Learning Projects
In proposed open protocol, the sensorâ€™s raw data streams, de-identified on distributed IPFS file storage network, can be made available to community of BMD token holders and developers, who can utilize various machine learning and deep learning algorithms frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, CNTK, and MXNet to more efficiently refine accuracy not only on static, old historical data, but on constantly generated new live data.
